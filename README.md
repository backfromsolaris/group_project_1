<h3>Overview of project:</h3>
The goal of this project was to create a website using CSS3 modeled after a provided mock-up.<br><br>
We were also challenged to create a responsive design using Bootstrap or CSS Grid.<br><br>

    

<h3>Breakdown of project delegation:</h3>

- index.html & respective styles page completed by Mike.

- how_it_works.html & respective styles page completed by Noah.

- sign_in.html, sign_up.html, & respective styles pages completed by Zach.

- Navbar & footer section (shared by index.html & how_it_works.html) were completed collaboratively over live zoom (coded locally by Mike).

- README written by Zach.

- Main project branch hosted by Zach.

<h3>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h3>

- We experienced several obstacles during different Github push/pull/merge instances.<br>
    - We realized that coordinating on a firm schedule
      for when to both push to main & pull as a team could eliminate some complications.
- We also became more savvy with troubleshooting Github errors in general, and were able
  to overcome some issues by running local manual merges.<br>
- Utilizing Bootstrap Flex Box more in general was a learning experience for our group.
- Resolving merge conflicts are best done when all parties are looking at them, if the branch manager is not 100% certain of how to resolve.
